      Name: Dole 11 oz. Can Mandarin Oranges in Light Syrup - 12/Case
      
      Description: These Dole 11 oz. mandarin oranges offer a simple, refreshingly sweet addition to fruit salads and salad bars, and a variety of delicious dishes. A bit smaller than a traditional orange, these mandarin oranges provide the unmistakably tangy citrus notes, but with a slightly sweeter flavor. The oranges are already broken into small, bite-sized segments to save valuable prep time, while the can features an easy open pull tab lid that conveniently eliminates the need for a can opener. A great source of vitamin C, these all natural mandarin oranges are sure to please your health-conscious patrons.
  
      These mandarin oranges are packaged in their own natural light syrup, making them a simple yet great-tasting standalone side dish that can be served straight from the can! Their cool, citrus taste can also be used to enhance cottage cheese side dishes, crisp green salads, and full-bodied yogurt. You can even add them to Asian-inspired dishes like shrimp, beef, and chicken stir fry for a unique ethnic flair.
